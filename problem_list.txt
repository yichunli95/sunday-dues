1. photos that appear across multiple albums:
   - how many are there percentage wise?
   - if we remove duplicates during the dataset when getting image features in corresponding order, does that break the time sequence when feeding into the model?
        e.g.: we have 2 albums for this question with the following pids: [1,2,3,4], [5,2,6,7]
                - by removing duplicates, we finally feed into the model [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] instead of [1,2,3,4,5,2,6,7]
   - does this matter?
